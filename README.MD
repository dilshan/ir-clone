IR Remote Control Clone Utility
===============================

IR Clone is an open-source infrared remote control signal analysis and generating tool. This utility can clone IR signals, examine the IR remote control signals, and modify or create new IR signals. 

This project consists of both hardware and software utilities. The hardware module contains an 8-bit MCU, 32Kbit EEPROM, IR receiver, and transmitter.

The software application provides options to decode captured data and generate new IR signals.

IR Clone is an open-source project. All the schematics, PCB design files, firmware source codes, and application source codes are available in this repository.

The complete [documentation](https://github.com/dilshan/ir-clone/wiki) of this project is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/dilshan/ir-clone/wiki) section of this repository. The PCB Gerber files and compiled binaries are also available in the release section of this repository.
