IR Clone Utility
================

IR Clone is an open-source infrared remote control signal analysis and generating tool. This utility can clone IR signals, examine the IR remote control signals, and modify or create new IR signals. 

This project consists of both hardware and software utilities. The hardware module contains an 8-bit MCU, 32Kbit EEPROM, IR receiver, and transmitter.

The software application provides options to decode captured data and generate new IR signals.

IR Clone is an open-source project. All the schematics, PCB design files, firmware source codes, and application source codes are available in this repository.
